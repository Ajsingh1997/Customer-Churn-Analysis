# Customer-Churn-Analysis
#This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and identify key factors influencing customer retention
#Using Python and Pandas, we explore various aspects such as contract types, payment methods, service usage, and demographic details to determine their impact on churn.
#The analysis includes data visualization through charts to highlight trends, correlations, and risk factors.
##  **Key insights reveal that month-to-month contracts, electronic check payments, and lack of additional services significantly contribute to churn
#The project provides actionable recommendations, such as encouraging long-term contracts, bundling value-added services, and improving customer engagement strategies, to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.
